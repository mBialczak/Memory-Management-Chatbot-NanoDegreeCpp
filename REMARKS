## In the chatbot.h and chatbot.cpp:

1.  I have modified the chatbot constructor (taking more arguments)

## TASK 5

I was able to reproduce the console output shown on the instruction materials, that is:

ChatBot Constructor
ChatBot Move Constructor
ChatBot Move Assignment operator
ChatBot Destructor
ChatBot Destructor
ChatBot Move Constructor
ChatBot Move Assignment operator
ChatBot Destructor
ChatBot Move Constructor
ChatBot Move Assignment operator
ChatBot Destructor
ChatBot Destructor
ChatBot Destructor
ChatBot Destructor
ChatBot Destructor
ChatBot Destructor
ChatBot Destructor
ChatBot Destructor
ChatBot Destructor

but I have realised that I can optimize the code a bit by changing the graphnode.h and graphnode.cpp
from
void GraphNode::MoveChatbotHere(ChatBot chatbot)

to  
void GraphNode::MoveChatbotHere(ChatBot&& chatbot)".

In this way some calls to move copy constructors and destructors could be spared, so only the Move Assignment operator is called (although the move constructor is still implemented):

ChatBot Constructor
ChatBot Move Assignment operator
ChatBot Destructor
ChatBot Move Assignment operator
ChatBot Move Assignment operator
ChatBot Move Assignment operator
ChatBot Move Assignment operator
ChatBot Move Assignment operator
ChatBot Destructor
ChatBot Destructor
ChatBot Destructor
ChatBot Destructor
ChatBot Destructor
ChatBot Destructor
ChatBot Destructor
ChatBot Destructor
